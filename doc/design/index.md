# FortFEM Design Documentation

## Overview

FortFEM is designed with the following principles:
- **Natural mathematical notation**: Express weak forms as you would write them mathematically
- **Modularity**: Clear separation between mesh, function spaces, assembly, and solvers
- **Performance**: Efficient sparse matrix operations and assembly routines
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new element types and problem formulations

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Mesh Module** (`fortfem_mesh_*`)
   - Handles mesh data structures and connectivity
   - Supports triangular and quadrilateral elements
   - Provides mesh I/O and generation utilities

2. **Function Space Module** (`fortfem_function_space`)
   - Defines finite element spaces on meshes
   - Manages degrees of freedom (DOF) numbering
   - Handles boundary condition identification

3. **Basis Functions** (`fortfem_basis_*`)
   - Implements shape functions and their derivatives
   - Supports P1/P2/Q1 and verified lowest-order Nédélec/RT0 kernels
   - Handles reference-to-physical element transformations

4. **Assembly Module** (`fortfem_assembly_*`)
   - Assembles global matrices and vectors from element contributions
   - Uses efficient quadrature rules
   - Supports various bilinear and linear forms

5. **Solver Module** (`fortfem_solver`)
   - Interfaces to LAPACK and includes custom GMRES implementation
   - Provides both direct and iterative methods
   - Includes GMRES implementation

## Design Patterns

### Object-Oriented Approach
FortFEM uses Fortran's object-oriented features:
```fortran
type :: mesh_2d_t
    real(dp), allocatable :: vertices(:,:)
    integer, allocatable :: triangles(:,:)
    integer :: nvert, ntri
contains
    procedure :: init => mesh_2d_init
    procedure :: destroy => mesh_2d_destroy
end type
```

### Generic Programming
The library uses interfaces for flexibility:
```fortran
interface assemble
    module procedure assemble_mass_p1
    module procedure assemble_stiffness_p1
    module procedure assemble_mass_p2
end interface
```

## Element Types

### Lagrange Elements
- **P1**: Linear polynomials on triangles (implemented)
- **P2**: Quadratic polynomials with 6 DOFs per triangle (implemented)

### Vector Elements

- **Nédélec**: Verified lowest-order basis, covariant Piola map, orientation,
  and curl-mass assembly.
- **Raviart--Thomas**: Verified RT0 basis, contravariant Piola map,
  orientation, and div-mass assembly.
- High-level executable vector forms remain experimental.

## Weak Form Framework

The design allows natural expression of weak forms:
```fortran
! Poisson equation: -∆u = f
! Weak form: ∫∇u·∇v dx = ∫fv dx
call assemble_stiffness(mesh, V, A)
call assemble_load(mesh, V, f, b)
```

## Memory Management

- Uses allocatable arrays for dynamic memory
- Automatic cleanup through finalizers
- Efficient sparse storage formats (CSR/CSC)

## Future Directions

- 3D element support
- Adaptive mesh refinement
- Parallel assembly and solvers
- More element types (DG, HDG)
